# üáßüá∑ Political Attitude Networks in Brazil using ResIN

This repository applies the **Response Item Network (ResIN)** method to Brazilian political survey data (*Pol√≠tica Brasil.csv*). The analysis compares respondents who identify with the **Left** and the **Right**, mapping how their political attitudes interconnect into coherent ideological structures.  

The approach builds on recent work in **network psychometrics and attitude systems**, particularly:

## üìä Methodology

1. **ResIN networks** were constructed separately for Left and Right respondents.  
   - **Nodes** = response options (e.g., Q1: Concordo, Q1: Discordo).  
   - **Edges** = co-endorsement, i.e., the correlation between binary response vectors.  
2. A **difference network** (Œî Left ‚Äì Right) highlights divergences in association strength.  
   - **Red edges** = stronger within the Left.  
   - **Yellow edges** = stronger within the Right.  
3. **Homogeneity metrics** (density, average strength, modularity) quantify the structural organization of each group.

# üß† Graphical Results

### **Graph 1 ‚Äì ResIN (Left)**  
![ResIN Left](resin_left.png)  

The Left network shows **cohesive clusters** around redistribution, social programs, minority rights, and environmental regulation. While certain clusters are strongly interconnected, the overall structure retains **subgroups and fragmentation**, indicating ideological diversity within the Left.  

---

### **Graph 2 ‚Äì ResIN (Right)**  
![ResIN Right](resin_right.png)  

The Right network displays a **denser and more unified structure**, with broad connectivity across immigration, firearms, and attitudes toward government regulation. The network suggests a **higher degree of internal coherence**, with fewer isolated clusters compared to the Left.  

---

### **Graph 3 ‚Äì Difference Network (Œî Left ‚Äì Right)**  

**Full labels version:**  
![Difference Network Full](resin_diff_full.png)  

**Simplified labels version:**  
![Difference Network Simple](resin_diff_simple.png)  

This network captures the **fault lines of polarization**.  
- **Red edges** highlight associations stronger among the Left (e.g., redistribution linked with minority rights and welfare expansion).  
- **Yellow edges** highlight associations stronger among the Right (e.g., immigration paired with firearm policy).  

The structural divergence indicates that Left and Right not only disagree on policy outcomes but also organize their **belief systems differently**.  

---

### **Graph 4 ‚Äì Homogeneity Comparison**  
![Homogeneity Comparison](resin_homogeneity.png)  

Three network-level measures provide a quantitative comparison:  
- **Density**: Higher for the Right, reflecting more realized associations across issues.  
- **Average strength**: Slightly higher for the Left, meaning that when clusters form, ties are more intense.  
- **Modularity**: Higher for the Left, showing the presence of distinct ideological subgroups, while the Right remains less fragmented.

# üåç Interpretation

The results reveal **asymmetries in ideological organization**:  

- The **Left** is structured around **modular clusters**, with strong coherence in domains of equality and inclusion but overall greater internal diversity.  
- The **Right** is characterized by a **denser, more integrated system**, where cultural conservatism, nationalism, and economic attitudes cohere into a unified ideological frame.  
- Polarization emerges not only from disagreements on specific issues, but from **differences in belief architecture**: one side allows for pluralism within clusters, the other builds broader internal consistency.  

This structural asymmetry helps explain how each camp mobilizes and maintains ideological identity: the Left by fostering **issue-specific intensity** within clusters, and the Right by sustaining **broad integrative coherence** across issues.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook **`network.ipynb`**.

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook network.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells. The notebook will:

   * Generate and save the four graphs (`resin_left.png`, `resin_right.png`, `resin_diff_full.png`, `resin_diff_simple.png`, `resin_homogeneity.png`).
   * Print the **reference map** linking question codes (Q1‚ÄìQ8) to Portuguese survey items and their English translations.
