# üáßüá∑ Political Attitude Networks in Brazil using ResIN

This repository applies the **Response Item Network (ResIN)** method to Brazilian political survey data (*Pol√≠tica Brasil.csv*). Inspired by recent advances in **network psychometrics** and attitude systems, the analysis compares respondents who identify with the **Left** and the **Right**.  

The project builds upon methodological work such as:  

- Jonas Dalege et al. (2017). *The attitude network approach to attitudes: The structure of interconnections predicts attitude strength.* *Nature Human Behaviour.*  
- Stelling et al. (2024). *Response Item Network (ResIN): A novel method to study the internal structure of responses.* *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications.* [[Nature link]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-024-03037-x)

## üìä Methodology

1. **ResIN networks** are built for Left and Right respondents.  
   - Nodes represent question‚Äìresponse pairs.  
   - Edges represent co-endorsement (correlation between binary response patterns).  
2. A **difference network** (Œî Left ‚Äì Right) highlights divergences between groups.  
   - Red = stronger associations among the Left.  
   - Yellow = stronger associations among the Right.  
3. **Homogeneity metrics** (density, average edge strength, modularity) quantify the degree of internal coherence within each group.

# üß† Explanation of Graphs

### **Graph 1 ‚Äì ResIN (Left)**

This network depicts the attitudinal structure of respondents who identify with the **Left**. Each node is a survey response (Q1, Q2, ‚Ä¶), and edges show how often two responses co-occur. Stronger co-endorsements appear as thicker edges.  

![ResIN Left](resin_left.png)  

*Interpretation*: The Left shows **selective cohesion**. Redistribution and minority rights cluster strongly, while other issues form looser connections.  

---

### **Graph 2 ‚Äì ResIN (Right)**

The corresponding network for respondents who identify with the **Right** shows a denser, more evenly distributed structure.  

![ResIN Right](resin_right.png)  

*Interpretation*: The Right exhibits **more diffuse but stable coherence**, with issues like immigration, firearms, and economic policy binding attitudes more consistently together.  

---

### **Graph 3 ‚Äì Difference Network (Œî Left ‚Äì Right)**

This visualization isolates the **fault lines of polarization**.  

- **Red edges**: associations stronger within the Left (e.g., redistribution + minority rights).  
- **Yellow edges**: associations stronger within the Right (e.g., immigration + firearms).  
- Two versions are displayed: **full labels** (Qn:Response) and **simplified labels** (Qn only).  

**Full labels version:**  
![Difference Network Full](resin_diff_full.png)  

**Simplified labels version:**  
![Difference Network Simple](resin_diff_simple.png)  

*Interpretation*: Polarization is not only about endorsing different positions, but about **different ways of connecting beliefs**. The Left fuses equality-related issues, while the Right couples cultural and security concerns.  

---

### **Graph 4 ‚Äì Homogeneity Comparison**

This bar chart compares Left and Right networks across three metrics:  

- **Density** ‚Üí more realized associations.  
- **Average strength** ‚Üí stronger ties overall.  
- **Modularity** ‚Üí degree of fragmentation into clusters.  

![Homogeneity Comparison](resin_homogeneity.png)  

*Interpretation*: The Right is **more homogeneous**, with higher density and integration. The Left shows **greater internal differentiation**, forming modular clusters of coherence.  

---

# üåç Broader Meaning

These results suggest that polarization in Brazil is not limited to disagreement over single issues. Instead, Left and Right differ in how their beliefs are **structured internally**.  

- The **Left** forms intense but modular clusters centered on equality and inclusion.  
- The **Right** exhibits a denser, less fragmented system, where cultural and security issues are tightly bound together.  

This asymmetry helps explain how each camp mobilizes and negotiates internal diversity: the Left allows more pluralism within its structure, while the Right is unified by a broader ideological frame.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
pip install -r requirements.txt

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

The full analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook **`network.ipynb`**.

1. Make sure you have **Jupyter** installed (via `pip install jupyterlab` or `conda install jupyterlab`).

2. Launch the notebook environment:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook network.ipynb
   ```

3. Open the notebook in your browser, execute the cells step by step, and the following outputs will be generated automatically:

   * **ResIN - Left** (`resin_left.png`)
   * **ResIN - Right** (`resin_right.png`)
   * **Difference Network (full labels)** (`resin_diff_full.png`)
   * **Difference Network (simplified labels)** (`resin_diff_simple.png`)
   * **Homogeneity comparison bar chart** (`resin_homogeneity.png`)

The notebook also prints the **reference map** linking question codes (Q1, Q2, ‚Ä¶) to the original Portuguese survey questions and their English translations.
